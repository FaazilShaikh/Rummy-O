Note: The game was rushed as this was for a project, I made commits for the last 2 or so days on a school repository(not including today I finished last night),I decided to post this just an example of what I am capable of, the code was rushed for the most part especially for the client side (game.js) and some of the server side, but I may clean up the code from time to time whenever I have the time, I just didn't have time to clean it up as I wanted to make sure I had all the features I have on here currently, but I made sure it was at least working with minimal bugs. So overall, I think this was a success.

Modules description:

server.js
- all the server side code and logic which should not be on the client for the game
